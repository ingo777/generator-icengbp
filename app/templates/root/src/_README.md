See each directory for a detailed explanation.

## `index.html`

The `index.html` file is the HTML document of the single-page application (SPA)
that should contain all markup that applies to everything in the app, such as
the header and footer. It declares with `ngApp` that this is `<%= projectName %>`,
specifies the main `AppController` controller, and contains the `ngView` directive
into which route templates are placed.
